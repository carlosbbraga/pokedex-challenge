# pokedex-challenge 
Pokedex Challenge using React.Js

### Difficulty: Medium | Time required: ~ 30 minutes

# Requirements
  - Build a Pokedex like Table that shows the first 100 Pokemon
  - Use a Real Life API to fetch pokemons GET ( https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=100 )
  - The Pokemons should be displayed one by Square in order with theirs Names, Image (official-artwork) and PokedexNumber (a.k.a Id)
  - By Clicking on a Pokemon, a display must appear showing all of his "moves" (ex: "mega-punch") and his type "Ex: Fire" )
 
# Tips
  - For fetching Pokemon Image (official-artwork) and Moves youÂ´ll need to make a specific request for each pokemon passing his id or name as a parameter.
    GET ( https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/4 ) OR GET ( https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/charmander ) will have the same result
  - Api Documentation for reference if needed ( https://pokeapi.co/ )
